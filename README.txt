Ideas




March Madness
- Create each matchup as a node
    - If a team wins, the next game points to the next node
    - You could create a variable "tournamentWins" to add to a teams prestige

Awards at the end of season (pre tournament)
    - Best Defense
        - Team with lowest points against
    - Best Offense
        - Team with most points
    - Best +/-
        - Team with best points vs points agianst ratio
        (I feel this would be the number 1 seed)
